In this tutorial, we’re going to build a Todo app using Meteor and React.  We'll be taking a somewhat different approach from [the official Meteor React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) and adding a few more bells and whistles along the way.

- [Finished version of the app](http://intro-to-meteor-react.meteor.com/)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react)

##Prerequisites 
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and use of a command line terminal.
- A laptop with a code editor of your choice.  We’ll be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3 ).
- Be sure to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). We’ll be using Mac OSX. However, Meteor is available for Windows and Linux as well.

## Getting Started
Each step in the tutorial has a corresponding branch in the [github repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react).  I highly recommend that you create the app on your own, but if you should get stuck, you can always check out the branch from the previous step to get caught up.
