In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to build a Todo app using Meteor and React.  We'll be taking a somewhat different approach from [the official Meteor React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) and adding a few more bells and whistles along the way.

- [View the demo app](http://intro-to-meteor-react.meteor.com/)
