#Introduction to Meteor and React

In this tutorial, we’re going to build a Todo app using Meteor and React.  We'll be taking a somewhat different approach from [the official Meteor React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) and adding a few more bells and whistles along the way.

Here is the finished version of the app we’ll build.

## What you'll learn
_TBD_

##Prerequisites 
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and use of a command line terminal.
- A laptop with a code editor of your choice.  We’ll be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3 ).
- Also, be sure to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). We’ll be using Mac OSX. However, Meteor is available for Windows and Linux as well.
